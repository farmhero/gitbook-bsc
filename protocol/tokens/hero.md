## Deflationary Design via in-house Games

Both the auction game and the fomo game are designed to burn $HERO token continuously. It will ensure that $HONOR price is supported and avoid the sell-off of normal yield farming protocols.

| Percentage | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| 30% | Reserved for Future NFT Farming |
| 30% | Vault Farming |
| 20% | Reserve for Ecosystem such as partnership and future incubation |
| 5% | Genesis NFT Farming |
| 10% | Team |
| 5% | Community Rewards such as bug bounty, marketing campaign, airdrops |

Right now, as we are at genesis yield farming, most of the tokens produced each day \(60% around\) are locked. Please check our website for the current circulating amount of HONOR token. With the deflationary design the team expect the token supply would be stabled at 300 million - 400 million.

## Max Supply

There is a max supply of 500 million HONOR tokens. When it reaches 500 million, HONOR won't mint. Tho this might change according to DAO vote by $HONOR token holders.
