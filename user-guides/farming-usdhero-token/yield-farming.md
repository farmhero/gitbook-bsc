# Yield Farming \(Vaults\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Freshly minted HONOR is considered vested until the 90 day vesting duration expires or it is withdrawn from the fee distribution contract.
{% endhint %}

Users can deposit designated tokens to earn $HONOR . Compared to other farms\(such as YFI\), the HONOR farm will NOT lock the funds in vain. To make use of the locked funds so that the HONOR protocol is a healthy, continuous one, the $HONOR pool will be built upon farms that are audited and secure.

The actual pool constitutions and multiples are subject to change. Please stay updated with latest news in our group and the doc here.

There is an extra single token staking pool for $HONOR where you can earn $USDC + $HONOR. The rewards come from Vault Farming.

## Deposit and Withdrawal

Users can freely deposit and withdraw tokens from pools anytime. But for certain pools within a limited time upon launch, there will be deposit fee.  The deposit fee is listed on pool.

There is a general early exit fee for the pools, depending on the deposit time.
