# Yield Farming \(Vaults\)

Users can deposit designated tokens to earn $Glory . Compared to other farms\(such as YFI\), the Glory farm will NOT lock the funds in vain. To make use of the locked funds so that the HERO protocol is a healthy, continuous one, the $Glory pool will be built upon farms that are audited and secure.

The actual pool constitutions and multiples are subject to change. Please stay updated with latest news in our group and the doc here.

There is an extra single token staking pool for $Glory, where you can earn $USDT. The rewards come from Vault Farming.
