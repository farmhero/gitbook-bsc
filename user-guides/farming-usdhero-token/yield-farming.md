# Yield Farming \(Vaults\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Freshly minted HERO is considered vested until the 90 day vesting duration expires or it is withdrawn from the fee distribution contract.
{% endhint %}

Users can deposit designated tokens to earn $HERO. Compared to other farms\(such as YFI\), the HERO farm will NOT lock the funds in vain. To make use of the locked funds so that the HERO protocol is a healthy, continuous one, the $Hero pool will be built upon farms that are audited and secure.

Currently, the pools are built upon QuickSwap main farms.

| Pool | Farm | Multiple | Limited Time Depoist Fee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| HERO-USDC | QUICKSWAP | 100X | NO |
| bHero-USDC | QUICKSWAP | 20X | YES |
| Matic-ETH | QUICKSWAP | 10X | YES |
| MATIC-USDC | QUICKSWAP | 10X | YES |
| USDT-ETH  | QUICKSWAP | 10X | YES |
| DAI-ETH | QUICKSWAP | 10X | YES |
| MATIC-QUICK | QUICKSWAP | 8X | YES |
| USDC-QUICK | QUICKSWAP | 8X | YES |
| BTC-USDC | QUICKSWAP | 5X | YES |
| BTC-ETH | QUICKSWAP | 5X | YES |
| USDC-DAI | QUICKSWAP | 4X | YES |

The actual pool constitutions and multiples are subject to change. Please stay updated with latest news in our group and the doc here.

There is an extra single token staking pool for $HERO, where you can earn $USDC + $HERO. The rewards come from Vault Farming.

## Deposit and Withdrawal

Users can freely deposit and withdraw tokens from pools anytime. But for certain pools within a limited time upon launch, there will be deposit fee.
