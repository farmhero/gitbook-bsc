# Genesis NFT

Genesis NFTs have a unique property: it will earn a fixed portion of the $Hero total supply per block. This property is exclusive for genesis NFTs.

Users can buy genesis NFT using BNB. Currently we offer three genesis NFT.

The NFT has to be deposited to NFT farm to earn $HERO. Users can withdraw anytime from NFT farm.

| Genesis NFT Name | ID | Amount | Unique Property |

If all genesis NFT are sold out and deposited to NFT farm, they will share 5.01% of the $Hero minted per block. Unsold, un-deposited genesis NFT will not share from the $Hero production and the rest of the unclaimed $Hero will stay in the contract for future burn.
