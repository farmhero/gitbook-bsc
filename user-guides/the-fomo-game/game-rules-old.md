# Game Rules \(old\)

#### Game Rules

Users can buy $Key using $Hero. They can purchase directly in the FarmHero App or on PancakeSwap.

There is a countdown timer for each round. Initially the timer counts down from 5 mins. 

User can deposit $Key to reset the countdown timer. Any $Key deposit with amount bigger than 1 will reset the timer back to 5 minutes.

#### **Rewards**

Deposited Keys grant instant dividends on all volume that flows through a round, meaning users will constantly receive a stream of passive income from the game as keys are bought until a round ends.

| Percentage | Usage of the deposited $KEY token |
| :--- | :--- |
| 50% | Burnt |
| 45% | Distributed to previous users who have deposited $KEY in current round |
| 5% | referral rewards |

#### Round Ends \(Pot Distribution\)

The last player to have deposited  at least 1 full key when the round timer completes its countdown, immediately drains 80% of the BUSD seen in the pot and ends the round. The rest of the 20% BUSD pot will be carried over to next round.

A round is preceded with a 5-minute starting grace period when deposits are not permitted. This is to help users to know what is going on and get ready for next round.

#### Resetting the KEY Price

Keys price will be reset on round ends. The FarmHero Protocol will use a 'reweight' mechanism to adjust the $KEY-$HERO pair price on pancake back to 1 million KEY and 1 million HERO. Extra $HERO will be burnt.
