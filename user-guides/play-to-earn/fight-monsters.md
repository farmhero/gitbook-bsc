# Fight Monsters

**How to Fight Monsters**

You need to use ‘Rounds’ to fight monsters. Your Hero will auto recover 1 round every 4 hours. The rarity of your hero determines the maximum rounds accumulated for your hero. 

```text
Max Rounds for the Hero = Number of Stars -1. 
```

So if you have a 6 star Hero, you can accumulate 5 rounds per day. For a 2 star hero, you need to fight every 4 hours so you do not waste your rounds.

#### Reward

The win rate against the monsters are fixed at the moment. The Hero’s Hashrate determines the reward you can get. 

```text
Winning Reward = Hero's Hashrate * Reward Multiple
```

#### Early Exit Fee

There will be a 15% early exit fee for claiming the fight rewards. But later this week we will be able to reveal a feature that you can use the fight reward to get Loot Boxes. If you want to claim the reward in full, the vesting time is 4 days.

Each new reward will rest the vesting timer back to 4 days.
