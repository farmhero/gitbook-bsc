# Referrals

## Setting up a Referral

The Fomo3D referral system is called the "Advisory Board". To join the advisory board, click the "Get A Name" link at the top and then pick a nickname for yourself. Joining the board costs 0.05 BNB which is contributed to the "community fund" and distributed to developers and community staff. Note that you must register a nickname name to receive referral rewards in your vault.

Once you are an advisor, you can copy your referral link from the "Referrals Tab" and share that with friends or members. You will earn 5% of all the $KEY put into the Fomo Game by anyone that joins through your link. This referral fee is paid to you for everyone you refer for all of their buys and reinvests. And this is all at no cost to them.

Referral links used by players are stored within the smart contract itself meaning that you will receive the referral fee for buys from all players you referred even across browsers or different computers ensuring that those marketing the game can receive substantial residual income over time from players.

## Replacing a Referral

You will continue to receive referral rewards from someone up until the point they purchase using someone else's referral link.

In the event that a player purchases keys without using a referral code and has never used a referral code previously, then that referral fee is not paid.
